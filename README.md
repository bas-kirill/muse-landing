# Muse Landing

Ladies and gentlemen, this is my first frontend test assignment for a tech company,
and I have only 50% confidence that I
understand what is being discussed.
The remaining 50% is just confidence that I can convince you that everything is
going according to plan :)
I hope that at least the second half is correct!
:)

This is landing including the following features:
* Desktop and mobile versions
* Client-side form validation
